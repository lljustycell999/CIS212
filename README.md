# CIS 212 - Analysis and Logical Design
This repository contains documentation for our assigned programming project as part of the CIS 212 - Analysis and Logical Design course at SUNY Jefferson taught by Professor Jack Donato.

Please note: This course only focuses on the preparation of the project, not the physical design, implementation, and deployment.
